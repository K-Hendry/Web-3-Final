            <p class="content-spacing">No roundup of political design can neglect to mention the now-iconic image of Obama, pictured above the word “Hope”. The Social Realist piece by street artist Shepard Fairey has spawned a thousand copy-cats, partly inspired by the artist’s own desire to encourage Obama supporters to develop their own images. These days you can create your own version using the wide array of generators on the internet, but the original is one of the most recognisable political designs in recent history.</p>
            <p class="content-spacing">The appeal of the image is in its simplicity — Obama was fresh-faced, a stark contrast to the weary incumbent George W. Bush and was on course to become the first African-American President of the United States. “Hope” not only summed up supporters’ desires for their President — it also summed up their ambition for America’s future.</p>
